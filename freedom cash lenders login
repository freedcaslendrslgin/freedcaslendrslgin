Loan safety is a two-way street. Borrowers want financial protection from predatory costs and property loss, and lenders are concerned with borrowers defaulting on their loans.

Loans are safe if you understand the terms and can repay the loan on time. They become threatening when you miss payments and begin to incur extra fees, collections, repossession actions, foreclosures, levies, and other penalties.

Payday loans provide the least financial protection because your debt can snowball if you miss payments. Auto and home equity loans can quickly become unsafe if you can’t make payments on time, as you may lose your car or your home. Personal loans are safer since they charge relatively reasonable interest rates and do not require collateral.

Defaulting on almost any loan can ruin your credit, even if the lender doesn’t report payments to a credit bureau. The damage occurs when the lender turns the loan over to a collection agency that reports to a credit bureau.

Not repaying a pawnshop loan won’t hurt your credit, but you will lose the item you pawned.
